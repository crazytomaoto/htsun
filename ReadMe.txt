Background:
Not long ago, a large number of projects with "DOGEs "on the moon as a gimmick appeared in the crypto currency field. Various Moon-themed tokens and project models emerged madly. However, the day when unhealthy projects eventually closed down, most of them were looking forward to it. The users have been harvested, which is heartbreaking. The reason is that there are a large number of currency holders in control, and the crazy selling has caused the currency price to decrease, and the entire network users are damaged. This behavior is not a manifestation of decentralization in the blockchain field at all. Now HTSUN is born, each transaction has up to 500 billion tokens, and each address can add or withdraw up to 50 billion liquidity. This fundamentally solves the control behavior and realizes true decentralization. It is the healthy operation of the project and users can use it with confidence.

HTSUN Introduction
Decentralization is the inevitable direction of the development of the blockchain field. However,there still are  many drawbacks in the current Defi locked warehouse mining model. For example, the tokens of some projects are not really 100% released from the contract through mining. Some people After getting a large number of tokens in the early stage, they can be sold at a high price. There is also a liquidity pool. The tokens are exchanged for a large number of mainstream coins, causing the price of the coins to plummet, and a large number of users suffer heavy losses. 
HTSUN was born in order to change the shortcomings existing in the traditional decentralized field. 100% of the tokens are released from smart contracts, and a single transaction is restricted. Anyone can trade up to 500 billion tokens per address. When holding more than 50 billion tokens, the contract will be automatically triggered and the tokens will be mortgaged into the liquidity mining pool, to a certain extent, to prevent a large number of people from selling down the price, which will damage the majority of users. In order to ensure the long-term and healthy operation of the project and the collective interests of the majority of users, we are forging ahead. What we are currently doing is not perfect, and we need colleagues in the community to work together!
